# dnimmo-bingo

Hello, 

I've purposely avoided adding any tools/frameworks/etc. for this task, so there aren't any complicated installation instructions. You will be able to clone the repo from Github with "git clone https://github.com/dnimmo/dnimmo-bingo.git", and run it locally on whatever your preferred method of running web projects locally is, without the need to install anything special.

I'll also continue to host the application here: http://node-js-103414.nitrousapp.com:8080/

In order to make the code easier to review and assess, I've not included any manner of a build step (which is also the reason I have not used SCSS or ES6 here). I have included minified JS and CSS files but they're not being served by the application, so that it's easier to look at the code through dev tools.

The only thing I've used here that is not my own is the 'Reset' CSS at the top of my CSS file, as I didn't feel there was any benefit in me re-writing that myself!

As the assignment didn't state a list of supported browsers, I've only tested this on the devices and browsers that I have to hand (those being a Chromebook Pixel, a Nexus 6P, a Nexus 9 and an iPhone).

Feel free to call me on 07795259771 if there's anything you'd like to discuss ahead of Thursday morning.

Thanks,
-David.
